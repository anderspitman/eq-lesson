# Introduction (12:45 - 5min)

* Was asked to teach about my favorite talk from conference. Is there really
  any choice other than Elder Uchtdorf's Hobbit talk?
* I don't teach very often
* Might be the last time I teach EQ in a YSA ward.
* Share Beast meme
* Want to share some things I wish I'd known at 22 and 26
  * Don't want you to think I know everything. I actually feel less sure of
    myself now than I used to. But I still feel this might be useful.
  * People probably did tell me these things; I just wasn't listening.

* Key Points/Themes
  * Staying excited about the journey
  * Distraction
  * Selfishness


# Bilbo - Staying excited (12:50 - 10min)

* Read section starting with "The story of Bilbo Baggins"
  * As you get older, it gets harder to keep that sense of excitment and
    adventure.
    * It's like exercising. It's much easier to stay in shape than to not
      work out for years and then try to get in shape.

* Questions
  * What's the analogy? What is he talking about here? What are the parallels?
  * How can we keep that sense of adventure? How do we stay excited about the
    Gospel?

* "There must have been parts of the mortal adventure that worried and even
  terrified God’s children, since a large number of our spiritual brothers and
  sisters decided against it."

* Questions
  * Have you ever thought about it like that? Maybe it wasn't so much
    rebellion for some people as it was risk-aversion.


# Distractions (1:00 - 10min)
* Read section "And yet, mortal life has a way of distracting us..."

* Satan the devil used to work by getting people to do bad things. Now it's
  much easier for him to get us to do nothing.

* Questions what are some of the distractions?

* Good, better, best.
* There are more quality TV shows than can ever be watched. There are more
  good books than can ever be read. There are more great video games than can
  ever be played, and more social media feeds than can ever be scrolled.
  * There was one time, about 6 years ago, that I managed to scroll to the
    end of my Facebook feed. That, my friends, is hitting rock bottom.
  * Be wary of these algorithms

* Crash course on machine learning
  * They're looking at one specific variable - money.
    * But it's hard to measure it directly, so they look at another variable,
      attention.
  * The entire point of these algorithms is to make a direct link between your
    lizzard brain and the bottom line of these companies.


# How to begin (1:10 - 5min)

* "If you hesitate in this adventure because you doubt your ability, remember
  that discipleship is not about doing things perfectly; it’s about doing
  things intentionally. It is your choices that show what you truly are, far
  more than your abilities."

# Avoiding selfishness (1:15 - 10min)
* Read entire Reach Out in Love to Others section

* Questions
  * Have you ever tried really avoiding getting caught doing something good?
    It is very much not in our nature.

* Missionary work
  * "May I remind you that God does not need you to “sell” the restored gospel
    or the Church of Jesus Christ.

    He simply expects you not to hide it under a bushel."
  * Read 1 Nephi 8:12
    * Sharing the Gospel needs to be natural. Not just for our personal
      sanity, but also to be effective.
    * Read section of It Works Wonderfully! talk

* Questions
    * Is the Gospel working for you?
    * What are some things you have found that make the Gospel work for you?


# Conclusion (1:25 - 5min)
* Potentially read from section When Should I Start?
* Bear testimony


# Extra (1:20 - 5-10min)
* Give everyone a random section, and have them look for:
  * Staying excited about the journey/Gospel
  * Avoiding selfishness
  * Mastering distraction
