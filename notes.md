* What do you think it means that the Gospel is about doing things
  intentionally, not perfectly?
* Avoid bad things by filling our hearts with the love of Christ so there's no
  room for them.
* Missionary work - is the Gospel working for you? If so, it's easy to share.
* As you get older, it gets harder to keep that sense of excitment and
  adventure.
* Enduring to the end isn't about holding out. It's about realizing that the
  journey IS the end. It's about the process of becoming something, not
  surviving long enough to get changed in the twinkling of an eye.
  * Analogy section - it's not about being cleansed at the last day. It's about
    being cleansed every day.

  * Randomly assign a paragraph to everyone, and have them look for
    distraction/selfishness in the paragraph.
